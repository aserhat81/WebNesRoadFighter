# Deployment Instructions for Electric Velocity Game

## Introduction

This is a static HTML5 web game built with Phaser. It can be hosted on various platforms that support static website hosting. Since the game primarily uses procedurally generated assets or loads libraries like Phaser via a Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are no complex build steps involved.

## Method 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended for users with GitHub accounts)

GitHub Pages is a great way to host your static website directly from your GitHub repository for free.

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
    *   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in or sign up.
    *   Create a new **public** repository. Give it a name (e.g., `electric-velocity-game-deployment`).

2.  **Upload the game files:**
    *   Upload the entire contents of the `electric_velocity_game` directory (which includes `index.html`, the `js` folder with `game.js`, and the `assets` folder) to the root of your new GitHub repository.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository's main page on GitHub.
    *   Click on the "Settings" tab.
    *   In the left sidebar, navigate to the "Pages" section.
    *   Under the "Build and deployment" section, for "Source," select "Deploy from a branch."
    *   Choose the branch you uploaded your files to (e.g., `main` or `master`).
    *   For the folder, select `/ (root)`.
    *   Click "Save."

4.  **Access your game:**
    *   It might take a few minutes for your site to be built and become live.
    *   The URL will typically be in the format: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`
    *   GitHub Pages will indicate the live URL in the "Pages" settings once it's ready.

## Method 2: Netlify (Drag and Drop)

Netlify offers a very simple way to deploy static sites, often with a generous free tier.

1.  **Sign up for Netlify:**
    *   Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up for a free account.

2.  **Deploy your site:**
    *   After logging in, go to your "Sites" dashboard.
    *   Find the area that says something like "Drag and drop your site folder here."
    *   Drag the entire `electric_velocity_game` folder (the actual folder, not a ZIP file) from your computer onto this area.

3.  **Access your game:**
    *   Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site. This is usually very fast.
    *   Once deployed, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL (e.g., `https://<random-name>.netlify.app`). You can customize this subdomain later in Netlify's site settings if desired.

## General Advice

*   **`index.html` at the Root:** Ensure that the `index.html` file is at the root of the directory you are deploying. This is the default entry point for web servers.
*   **No Build Steps Needed:** This particular game uses Phaser via a CDN and generates its core visual assets procedurally. Therefore, you do not need to run any build commands (like `npm run build`) before deploying. Just upload the existing files and folders as they are.
*   **`assets` Folder:** While most assets are procedural, the `assets` folder is included for good structure. If you were to add external image or sound files later, you would place them there and update the paths in `js/game.js` accordingly.

That's it! Your game should now be live on the web.
